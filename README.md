# Welcome

Welcome to the CSS SQL Networking team's tools repository.

Here, you will find a number of tools that we use when supporting our customers to help find solutions to problems faster and easier.

These tools all run locally and do not use any external services or report back to Microsoft or anyone else. For example, the SQL Network Analyzer tool reads a network trace on your local machine and writes the report to the same folder or to some location you explicitly designate.
