# Welcome 

Welcome to the CSS SQL Networking team's tools repository.

Here, you will find a number of tools that we use when supporting our customers to help find solutions to problems faster and easier.

These tools all run locally and do not use any external services or report back to Microsoft or anyone else. For example, the SQL Network Analyzer tool reads a network trace on your local machine and writes the report to the same folder or to some location you explicitly designate.

# Tools

**[SQL Network Analyzer](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS_SQL_Networking_Tools/wiki/SQLNA)** - a command-line tool that reads a network trace (or series of chained traces) and produces a report indicating potential problems.

**[SQL Network Analyzer UI](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS_SQL_Networking_Tools/wiki/SQLNAUI)** - a GUI interface for SQL Network Analyzer.

**[SQL Check](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS_SQL_Networking_Tools/wiki/SQLCHECK)** - a command-line tool that records system information useful for analyzing SQL Server client-server connectivity issues.

**[SQL Benchmark Tool](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS_SQL_Networking_Tools/wiki/SQLBENCH)** - a command-line tool that performs a standard set of operations on a file folder/share or database, so you can compare systems and databases.

**[SQL Driver Security API Trace](https://github.com/microsoft/CSS_SQL_Networking_Tools/wiki/SSPICLIENT)** - an MFC Windows C++ Tool that can be run on client machines having SSPI or Kerberos errors and will log a detailed trace for analysis.
